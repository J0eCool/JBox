This software is published under a very permissive license. In short, do whatever you'd like
with this code, or any assets herein. In keeping with the Hacker Ethic, it is not using a
standard open-source license. If you have a legal team and this makes them uncomfortable,
you probably shouldn't use any of it.

Are you a Bad Enough Dude to use this software?
