Asynchronous Background Networking On The Macintosh

* In oversimplified form, the algorithm operates as follows: When a new message is first heard, it is considered "hot." The program then tries to tell other network nodes the new message. When a node passes on a message, the receiving node tells whether it's already heard the message or not. The more times the program tries to spread the message to nodes that have already heard it, the cooler the message becomes. Eventually it becomes completely cold and the program stops trying to spread the message to more nodes. The people at Xerox called the action of this algorithm "rumor mongering."
